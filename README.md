## Project 1: Sakila DVD Rental database
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

### The questions answered through analysis of the data:
-Which Movie Category has been rented out the most until now?
-For all rental orders until now, how does the length of rental duration to “Animation” category compare to the duration that all other categories are rented for?
-How can we compare the number of movies in each quartile for each movie category?
-How many rentals did each store process in June and July of 2005?
